# Electromechanical_model
This is an electromechanical system modeling done using Simulink , thereby attached with the free body diagram, physical system.
We first consider the passive components(R,L,C) of electrical model and design differential equation. Similarly, with mechanical model.
Now, Use appropriate simulink blocks as per the system model equations and interconnect them (electrical and mechanical models) to get the overall electromechanical system.
Running the model in simulink, we get to observe the response of overall output of the system, displacement of the mechanical system along with the intermediate output, current.
